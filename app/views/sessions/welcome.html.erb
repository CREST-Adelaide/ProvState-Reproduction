	<h1>ProvState Prototype</h1>

	<p>
		This prototype was developed by The Centre for Research on Engineering Software Technologies (CREST) https://crest-centre.net. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This prototype demonstrate a concrete instantiation of the ProvState frameworkin the domain of software security. Each digital asset in this prototype represents a software security, which represents a change applied to the software code to correct the security weakness discovered by a vulnerability. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Enterprise security patch management is a complex and challenging process that involves multiple departments or even organisations. The ProvState prototype provides a secure and decentralised infrastructure to track, records, and make decisions on lifecycle events of software security patches. Every interaction with the assets via ProvState is assessed and authorised by secure smart contracts and recorded in a tamper-resistant manner in a blockchain for future analysis and investigation.
